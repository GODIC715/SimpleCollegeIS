An extremely simple student management system made with python3, pyqt5 and peewee using a sqlite3 database.

Subjects are currently fixed at 7 subjects with fixed names.

This was made as a project for college and it's not very advanced as I was the only one working on it. Had no time to try to add features like user management, adding subjects or assigning specific subjects to specific students or a timetable or any of that fancy stuff.

This is a barebones IS. feel free to fork it and edit it as much as you want.

Requires Pyqt5 and Peewee to be installed
You can simply install them through

"python -m --user pip install pyqt5 peewee"

Usage:
"python RunProgram.py"
You should now see a password window. The password is "Admin". It's case-sensitive.

All actual code/functions is handled in "RunProgram.py". All other .py are just QT .UI files converted into .py files.
